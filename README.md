- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheKingArthvr aka Arthur
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PC Hard- and Software
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be an "electronics technician for devices and systems" officially.
     Privately I am learning how to code my own Website with html/css/javascript, while also trying to make my first videogame.
     As soon as I have the time I want to learn how to create my own operating system - either from scratch or based on linux.
- ðŸ“« To reach me you can msg me on Github or Twitter. Soon I will implement a contact form on my website.
